Overview
--------

This Python script simplifie numbers,and percentages values in German-language text, preserving contextual meanings and improving readability. It utilizes regular expressions to process input, rounding numbers according to German conventions and handling dates in standard German formats. Non-German words are ignored, with only numbers being rounded and contextualized. The script also provides helpful explanations for numerical data. However, further improvements using NLP could significantly enhance its functionality and adaptability by enabling smarter content understanding and context-aware processing.
