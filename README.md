Overview

Monetary Value Context: Adds explanations for monetary values based on the amount (e.g., comparing amounts to house prices, car prices, or vacations).
Contextual Explanations: Adds contextual descriptions to numbers (e.g., "1 Million" â†’ "So much money you could buy 100 cars").
Date Preservation: Preserves date-related values and avoids modifying numbers that are part of date references.
